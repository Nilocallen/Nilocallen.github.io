**My degree is here!**

I am happy to say that I will be finished with my degree in a short 2 weeks!  I am currently working for Paychex as
an intern, and it's the last requirement before I can graduate.  So, it's time to start my career!

I'll be looking for a full time, preferably remote job in networking, low level/embedded systems, cyber security,
or software engineering.  Moving would be difficult, but it might be time to start making the difficult steps in 
this pivotal part of my career.  

Also, I got two cats with my girlfriend!  Pheobe and Harper.  

Goodbye for now!
