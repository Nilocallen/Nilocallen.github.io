**A small but feature packed Cisco network made in Cisco Packet Tracer.**

Here's a rich network built for my first networking class that uses subnetting, VLANs, OSPF, and NAT.  This class, and my first internship coding a network management software, are what got me sold on networking.<br><br><br><br><br>

<h4>The Topology</h4>
Every device in this network can ping every other device, including between networks, subnets, and VLANs.  This is the final topology:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

The labels on the topology are fairly comprehensive, so I wont re-iterate them now.  If you'd like a more thorough explanation, leave a comment letting me know!
