Hey there!  I'm a computer science grad from RIT seeking a full-time, preferably remote <br>or NYC stationed
role in computer science research, networking, cyber security, low-level/embedded systems, or software engineering. 

Although I'm open minded in which roles I'm seeking, I do have a few special interests that I would love to 
professionally explore.  Firstly, I love tying software to hardware.  This interest first blossomed in 
my high school robotics team, where I was the lead programmer and builder, and taught the newcomers how to
code.  In college, this interest evolved into my newest passion in the industry: low level hardware and 
software.  This began in one of my first 200 level courses, where I learned the inner workings of assembly language 
and CPUs.  The knowledge from this course lead to me messing around with arduinos and circuit simulations.
Lastly, I am especially interested in networking and cybersecurity after my first internship coding
network management software and a course at RIT on networking and data communication.  I love the idea of
creating and defending resilient and secure networks and would love to try my hand as a network engineer or
cyber security agent. 

I also love to be creative, and I do so these days by drumming for a band called Cellar Darts.  Our <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3by7mJaH793EiHkIzPijz4?si=1e1a98d8d0ba4da3" target="_blank">first single</a> is out now!  This is what I've been pursuing in the time from my last classes until now.  I've improved greatly and formed memories I'll always hold at our first concert on 4/01/23, but now I'm
ready to juggle both my musical passion and my career interests.
