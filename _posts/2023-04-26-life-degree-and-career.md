**Today, I'm writing on my future career direction, where I'll move, and clarifying my degree status.**

Hey!  I'm coming off of a short career break, and building this website to show what I've accomplished so far.  I'll be moving to New York City with my partner sometime in August, and my search for a full time computer science or software engineering job will begin once this site is complete and my resume is up to date.  Preferably, I find a role engaging more in computer science.  I love low level hardware and networking, so a career as a network engineer, cyber security practitioner, or embedded systems / CPU research would be perfect.  However, working as a software engineer would be a great stepping stone into the world of technical careers, and I equally welcome that chance.  

Allow me to elaborate on my degree status.  I have completed every course in the computer science cirriculum at the Rochester Institute of Technology, but I do not yet officially have my degree.  This is because RIT requires internships, called co-ops, before granting a degree.  Students are required to be working full time in a degree related field for two semesters and a summer.  I completed a co-op block for one semester and a summer, leaving one more semester required before getting my degree.  So, I plan to get a full-time job while I'm living in the city, and use the first 15 weeks of that as my co-op requirement, fulfilling my degree.  The specifics of my role do not need to be changed to meet this requirement; I can simply work full time like any other employee, then get my degree after 15 weeks.  I understand this is unconventional, but it won't complicate anything in my employment.  It just adds a *bit* of paperwork!

Thank you for your time!
